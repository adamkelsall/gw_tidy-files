# Progress

## Overview

`tf_fp_progress.rb` shows you the overall status of all of the listed directories in `persistent/directories`. This is designed to give you a sense of how far through your entire folder pass process you are.

As a result this script does not use its working directory and can be executed from anywhere.

## Arguments

*This script has no arguments*

## Sample Output

Uncomplete : 825   / 69.4%
```
