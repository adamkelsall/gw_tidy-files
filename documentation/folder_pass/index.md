# Overview

Folder Pass is a series of scripts designed to provide tracking on a list of directories, allowing you to review and make changes to these directories before marking them as completed against the list.

This has been designed specifically to allow a "quality pass" to be made against thousands of directories without forgetting which directories have been checked.

Folder Pass makes it easy to add and complete directories, as well as check the status of multiple directories at once.

## How It Works

[Click here](how_it_works.md) for a description of how Folder Pass achieves its goal, looks up and stores directory status information.
